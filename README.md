App I've made with code along with Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp".
<br /><br />
Mainly it was focused on getting yelpcamp work, not necessarily how it works.
<br /><br />
During this code along I've learnt about 
* node
* Express
* ejs
* mongoDB and mongoose
* RESTful Routing
* authentication and authorization
* deploying to Heroku and mongoLab.
